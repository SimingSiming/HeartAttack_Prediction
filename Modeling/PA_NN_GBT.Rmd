```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## This is for train and test data split 
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
standard_X <- read.csv("/Users/simingsu/Documents/NW_MLDS/2024_winter/pa2/project/HeartAttack_Prediction/FeatureEgnineering/standard_heartrate.csv")

y <- 
library(caret)
set.seed(123) 

index <- createDataPartition(df$, p=0.8, list=FALSE)
trainData <- data[index,]
testData <- data[-index,]
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
